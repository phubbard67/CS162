TITLE: CS 162 Homework hw5
==========================


INTRODUCTION
============
     The goal of this assignment is to work with inheritance, and understand
     how to properly construct and destruct derived objects.

     The "hw5 uml.pdf" file on the Desire2Learn server contains the class
     diagram for this assignment (see your instructor if you can not find
     this file).  You will create a 3-level hierarchy, with one parent
     class and 4 derived classes.     
     
     You will also create a class driver to test your implementation.
 

INSTRUCTIONS
============
     1. Create a project directory named "hw5".
          - This directory will contain all of your project files

     2. Copy the file
          "/home/student/doug.jones/public/handouts/162/hw5 instructions/base.tar"
        to your "hw5" directory

     3. Unpack the "base.tar" file into your "hw5" directory using the command
          tar -xf "base.tar"

        MAKE SURE your current working directory is your "hw5" directory when you
          issue the tar command

     4. Create the following modules in your project:
          - "media" module for your "Media" class
          - "broadcast" module for your "Broadcast" class
          - "internet" module for your "Internet" class
          - "tvstation" module for your "TVstation" class
          - "website" module for your "Website" class

     6. Define the following "Standard 8"  functions (methods) for all of your new modules:
          (a) Default constructor
          (b) Parameterized constructor to initialize word and count
          (c) Copy constructor
          (d) Move constructor
          (e) Destructor
          (f) Equivalence (==) operator
          (g) Copy assignment operator
          (h) Move assignment operator

     7. You may define dummy methods (no function) for the accessors and mutators shown in the class
        diagram.  These methods will be addressed in hw6

     8. Modify the main function in the appl module so that it is a test driver for each of the classes.
        This means you want invoke each of the "Big 8" methods for each class.
     
     9. Run valgrind and make sure there are no memory leaks.  Fix any memory leaks.

SUBMISSION
==========
     1. Create a tar archive of your entire hw5  directory from the parent directory, i.e.
          a) cd ..   (to get to the parent of your hw5 directory)
          b) tar -cf hw5.tar hw5  (to create the archive)

     2. Upload your hw5.tar archive to the Desire2Learn dropox for this assignment


GRADING
=======
      Keep in mind the grading guidelines listed in the course syllabus.  The points
      listed below supplement, rather than replace, those grading criteria.

      Your tarball should contain the directory "hw5" with all project files contained in the diretory.
      -1 point penalty if you mess this up.

      Do not modify any file(s) other than those listed in the instructions.  There
      is a -1 point penalty for each file that is modified outside of the instructions.
 
      There are 5 modules you must create, with 8 required methods for each module (i.e. the
      "Standard 8" methods). There is a -0.1 point penalty for each incorrect module method.
