TITLE: CS 162 Homework hw4
==========================


INTRODUCTION
============
     
     Your first object!  The goal of this assignment is to create an object.
     The object will be a "Word" object based on the struct from hw3.  You
     won't do anything with this object yet - the goal is merely to properly
     create the object.

INSTRUCTIONS
============
     1. Create a project directory named "hw4".
          - This directory will contain all of your project files

     2. Copy the file
          "/home/student/doug.jones/public/handouts/162/hw4 Instructions/base.tar"
        to your "hw4" directory

     3. Unpack the "base.tar" file into your "hw4" directory using the command
          tar -xf "base.tar"

        MAKE SURE your current working directory is your "hw4" directory when you
          issue the tar command

     4. Create a new module in the project named "word".  Create the word.h and word.cpp
        files, and modify the makefile to include the "word" module.  Remember, you
        should change only the MODULES variable in the makefile.

     5. The "word" module should define a class named "Word".  Your Word class definition
        should include the following instance variables:
               std::string * word;                     // String containing the word
               int * count;                            // Integer containing the word count

     6. Define the following "Standard 8"  functions (methods) for your Word class:
          (a) Default constructor
          (b) Parameterized constructor to initialize word and count
          (c) Copy constructor
          (d) Move constructor
          (e) Destructor
          (f) Equivalence (==) operator
          (g) Copy assignment operator
          (h) Move assignment operator

     7. Define the following public accessors for your Word class:
          (a) std::string getName();
          (b) std::string getCount();

     8. Modify the main function in the appl module as follows:
          (a) Create 4 Word variables
                 (i) varA("Hello")
                (ii) varB("World")
               (iii) varC(varB);
                (iv) varD

          (b) Test if varA == varB, i.e. test your equivalence operator
          (c) Assign varD = varA, i.e. test your copy assignment operator
          (d) Assign varD = move(varA), i.e. test your move assignment operator

     9. Run valgrind and make sure there are no memory leaks.  Fix any memory leaks.

SUBMISSION
==========
     1. Create a tar archive of your entire hw4  directory from the parent directory, i.e.
          a) cd ..   (to get to the parent of your hw4 directory)
          b) tar -cf hw4.tar hw4  (to create the archive)

     2. Upload your hw4.tar archive to the Desire2Learn dropox for this assignment


GRADING
=======
      Keep in mind the grading guidelines listed in the course syllabus.  The points
      listed below supplement, rather than replace, those grading criteria.

      Your tarball should contain the directory "hw4" with the files appl.h, appl.cpp,
      main.h, main.cpp, word.h, word.cpp, and makefile.
      -1 point penalty if you mess this up.

      Do not modify any file(s) other than those listed in the instructions.  There
      is a -1 point penalty for each file that is modified outside of the instructions.
 
      Your program must perform the tasks listed in Instructions above.
       -1 point penalty for each improperly implemented task.
