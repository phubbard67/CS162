TITLE: CS 162 Homework hw2
==========================


INTRODUCTION
============

     This assignment is a review of selection and repetition control structures
     from CS 161, but with a bit of a Linux twist.  You are going to write a
     a small command line utility that accepts input from stdin (cin) and counts
     the number of
          1) Total bytes in the input
          2) Number of upper-case letters
          3) Number of lower-case letters
          4) Number of lines (i.e. number of \n characters)
          5) Number of digit characters (i.e. '0' through '9'

     The program should read from stdin until EOF is encountered.

INSTRUCTIONS
============
     1. Create a project directory named "hw2".
          - This directory will contain all of your project files

     2. Copy the file
          "/home/student/doug.jones/public/handouts/162/hw2 Instructions/hw2 base.tar"
        to your "hw2" directory

     3. Unpack the "hw2 base.tar" file into your "hw2" directory using the command
          tar -xf "hw2 base.tar"

        MAKE SURE your current working directory is your "hw2" directory when you
          issue the tar command

     4. Modify the appl.cpp file to peform the following:
          a) Read from cin until EOF is encountered
          b) Display the total number of byte, upper-case letters, lower-case letters,
             digits, and lines in the input

        There is no need to implement functions at this point - functions are a little
        tricky with the program structure I've given you, and we'll talk about them
        for the Homework 3 assignment.  For this assignment you should put all of your
        code in the "main" function in the appl.cpp source code file.
     

SUBMISSION
==========
     1. Create a tar archive of your entire hw2  directory from the parent directory, i.e.
          a) cd ..   (to get to the parent of your hw2 directory)
          b) tar -cf hw2.tar hw2  (to create the archive)

     2. Upload your hw2.tar archive to the Desire2Learn dropox for this assignment


GRADING
=======
      Keep in mind the grading guidelines listed in the course syllabus.  The points
      below supplement, rather than replace, the criteria listed in the syllabus.

      Your tarball should contain the directory "hw2" with the files appl.h, appl.cpp,
      main.h, main.cpp, and makefile.  I will be looking to make sure you created the
      tarball in the correct way.  -1 point penalty if you mess this up.
 
      The only file you should modify is appl.cpp - no other source files should be
      edited.  -1 point penalty if you mess this up.
 
      Your code must compile and execute.  -5.0 point penalty if the code does not
      compile properly using the make file provided.
 
      Your program must perform the tasks listed in Instruction (4) above.
       -1 point penalty for each incorrect count.
